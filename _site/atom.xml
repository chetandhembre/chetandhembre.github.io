  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>There was buzz among my developer friends on twitter about recent announcement of <a href="https://twitter.com/flipkart_tech/status/663929833307574272">flipkart lite</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/anandc/status/664833643215392769">snap-lite</a>. When you have millions of people using highly unrealiable network we need this kind of initiative from big companies. Hoping others will follow it.</p>

<p>But as software developer I am more interested in how they built this experience. Flipkart shared their story <a href="http://tech-blog.flipkart.net/2015/11/progressive-web-app/">here</a>. They use lots of cool features which are implemented in chrome. One of thing which stand out is use of <code>service worker</code>. Which bring me to question <code>What are service worker?</code></p>

<h3>Specification</h3>

<p>Service worker is standard build by W3C working group. Here is how specification explain service worker</p>

<pre><code>
The service worker is a generic entry point for event-driven background processing in the Web Platform 
that is extensible by other [specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#extensibility).
</code></pre>

<p>you can read full specification <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/">here</a> if you want to read 10&rsquo;s pages.If you want brief introduction to build your application using it then carry on reading this post.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s asked ourself following questions about <code>service worker</code> and get answer for each one them</p>

<ol>
<li>Why should I use service worker ?</li>
<li>What are service worker ?</li>
<li>How to use service worker ?</li>
</ol>


<h3>Why shuold I use service worker ?</h3>

<p>Here is list of where you can use service worker.</p>

<ol>
<li>You can control frontend caching using service worker. No need to use (ambiguos)[http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag] <code>App Cache</code>. So your website will load fast.</li>
<li>You can build <code>offline first</code> app</li>
<li>You can implement native app like <code>background sync</code> feature in web app.</li>
<li><code>push notification</code> to your website. finally :clap:</li>
</ol>


<p>I will be writing blog post explaning every use case in near future. But first lets get our basic right.</p>

<h3>What are ServiceWorker ?</h3>

<p>here are some basic features of ServiceWorker</p>

<ol>
<li>ServiceWorker run in it&rsquo;s own thread in browser, it has it&rsquo;s own context</li>
<li>ServiceWorker is not tied to particular page but has it&rsquo;s own scope. (explain below)</li>
<li>ServiceWorker script does not run in main thread in browser. So it can not access DOM.</li>
<li>ServiceWorker can run even if webpage is not open (thats why it can do push notification and background sync)</li>
<li>ServiceWorker are <code>event driven</code> which means browser can start and terminate them depend on events</li>
<li>You can start service worker only on <code>https</code> (reason&rsquo;s are explain below)</li>
</ol>


<h3>How to use ServiceWorker ?</h3>

<p>After knowing all usecase and features of ServiceWorker you must be excited to use your awesome web app. But before that we need to know life cycle of ServiceWorker.</p>

<h3>Life cycle of ServiceWorker</h3>

<p>ServiceWorker can be one of step below</p>

<ol>
<li>Downloading</li>
<li>Installing</li>
<li>Error</li>
<li>Activated</li>
<li>Idle</li>
<li>Terminated</li>
</ol>


<p>Let&rsquo;s figure our what are these states stand for</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Downloading</p>

<p> When we asked browser to <code>register</code> script as ServiceWorker it gets downloaded. Every refresh will check if
 ServiceWorker script is changed or not. If changed then it will initiated ServiceWorker <code>Update</code> sequence (explained below).</p></li>
<li><p>Installing</p>

<p> after script downloaded browser installs it. In which it will create thread for script to run</p></li>
<li><p>Error</p>

<p> any uncaught exception in script will bring ServiceWorker in <code>Error</code> state. Do not worry next time you refresh page it will do through same step again.</p></li>
<li><p>Activated</p>

<p> If all things go right ServiceWorker goes to activation state. After that you can get all <code>fetch</code> event from page.</p></li>
<li><p>Idle</p>

<p> As name suggest when there are nothing to do in script, ServiceWorker goes to idle state.</p></li>
<li><p>Terminated</p>

<p> Browser control ServiceWorkers so it can terminate service worker any time. And you won&rsquo;t get any notification before that. But whenever event create in your web app browser will activate service worker.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Here is simple flow chart of ServiceWorker&rsquo;s lifecycle</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/static/img/sw-lifecycle.png" alt="life cycle of ServiceWorker" /></p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>here simple way to register your script as service worker</p>

<pre><code>if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/my-app/sw.js', {
    scope: '/my-app/'
  }).then(function(reg) {
    console.log('Yey!', reg);
  }).catch(function(err) {
    console.log('Boo!', err);
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>as code snippet says, We are first checking whether browser support ServiceWorker, <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers">here</a> is list of browser who support ServiceWorker.</p>

<p>If users browser support then we ask browser to download script from <code>/my-app/sw.js</code> path and register it as service woker. Api is promise base so we have to give success and failure callback.</p>

<p>Another important thing is registering script as service worker with <code>/my-app/</code> scope. ServiceWorker controls page which has url <code>/my-app/*</code>. If scope is not pass while registeration default is taking from path of script.</p>

<h3>Events in ServiceWorker</h3>

<p>remember I said service worker run in seperate thread than main thread of your web app. So main thread  communicate service worker using events.</p>

<p>following are event you can handle in Service Worker</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>install</code></p>

<pre><code class="`"> self.addEventListener('install', function (event) {
     console.log('service worker install successfully')
 })  
</code></pre>

<p> This event fired when first time or new version of service worker script get installs. We can do some cache/db initialization here.</p></li>
<li><p><code>activate</code></p>

<pre><code class="`">
 self.addEventListener('activate', function (event) {
     console.log('service worker in activated !!!')
 })
</code></pre>

<p> you can event saying service worker reach to &lsquo;activate&rsquo; state. And you can do good to go for your bussiness logic</p></li>
<li><p><code>fetch</code></p>

<pre><code class="` ">
 self.addEventListener('fetch', function (event) {
     console.log(event.request.url)
 })
</code></pre>

<p> This one of the most powerful feature service worker has.</p>

<p> Remeber I mentioned following things about service worker</p>

<ol>
<li>Service worker control page for given scope.</li>
<li>Service worker only works on <code>https</code> connection except localhost (use for testing)</li>
</ol>


<p> It is because this feature.</p>

<p> Service worker get fetch event on every request made by your web app. except following times</p>

<ol>
<li>iframes</li>
<li>service worker registration fetch calls</li>
<li>any fetch request from service worker itself to avoid infinite loop</li>
</ol>


<p> So in other times basically service worker can work as proxy to your web app. take following example</p>

<pre><code class="`"> self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
   fetch('/some-advertiser/log_url?url=' + event.request.url) //logging every outgoing request
   return fetch(event.request.url)
 });
</code></pre>

<p> If some how hacker hijack your servicer worker script then it can do real damage. In order to avoid
 <code>man in middle</code> attack <code>https</code> condition is in force.</p></li>
<li><p><code>message</code></p>

<pre><code class="`"> self.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
     //after getting message we send received data back to all control page
     self.clients.matchAll().then(function(clients) {
       clients.forEach(function(client) {
         console.log(client);
         client.postMessage(event.data);
       });
     });
 })
</code></pre>

<p> till now we are just know communication from page to service worker. But <code>postMessage</code> api gives bidirectional communication channel.</p>

<p> So in above example we are listening on message sent from controlled page using <code>postMessage</code> api, after getting message we just send message to all pages service worker controlled.</p>

<p> This is very useful for logging activity on page.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>am I controlling page now ?</h3>

<p>I have mentioned lot of time in this post about &lsquo;controlling page&rsquo; from service worker because of power full api we have.</p>

<p>But main question is when will your service worker control pages ?</p>

<p>As I mention in <code>Getting Started</code> that we need to register service worker. So When you register worker first time document is all ready loaded so service worker can not control page. But after you refresh page
service worker takes control.</p>

<p>Things get little interesting when you trying to update service worker scripts.</p>

<h3>Updating Service Worker</h3>

<p>Updating service worker code is tedious.</p>

<p>Remember service worker control all web page for given scope in addition to that we can have multiple page opens from same origin which can be in different state this makes updating service worker tedious.</p>

<p>Updating service following steps followed by <code>chrome</code> update.
So on every page refresh browser will check for service worker script update. It check bytewise for update of script. If new version of script found browser will download it in background and install it. But it wont make it active as multiple tab from same origin can use differnt service worker script which is not desirable.</p>

<p>So to activate newly updated service worker we have to close all tab from browser. Another way is if old service worker got garbage collected then next time when event fire from page it will start new updated service worker.</p>

<p>The easiest way at the moment is to close &amp; reopen the tab (cmd+w, then cmd+shift+t on Mac), or shift+reload then normal reload.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEshtDMHYyA">here</a> is video which demostrate how updating service worker works.</p>

<h3>Debugging Service Worker</h3>

<p>Service worker run in different thread in browser so debugging it is different than normal web page</p>

<p>in chrome you can go to <code>chrome://serviceworker-internals</code> to see all service worker running in your browser. In addition to that you can inspect service worker code. It is very powerful features. <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/serviceworker/service-worker-faq">Here</a> is place where you can get full info debugging service worker in chrome.</p>

<p>firefox is still building debugging tool for service worker <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1003097">here</a> is issue for that. But in firefox nightly you can do to <code>about:serviceworkers</code> to get service worker info (this is true when blog was written)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Web are always one step behind native apps on mobile. But <code>service worker</code> will really put native and web app neck to neck.</p>

<p>You can stay updated with <code>service worker</code> by readings <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/">this</a> website.</p>

<p>To get more info about service worker please follow following people on github and twitter</p>

  <updated>2015-11-10T15:35:21Z</updated>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I have been playing with react-native for one month. What I am doing in it will have it&rsquo;s own post :p</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into subject</p>

<h3>1. What is React ?</h3>

<p>You will find many very good explaination for <code>what is React ?</code> on internet and Details explaination will be out of scope for this post. But to get things started here is how we can explain react in nutshell</p>

<pre><code>react(data) =&gt; UI
</code></pre>

<p>It simply means <code>react</code> is function of <code>data</code> which give <code>UI</code>. So whenever data changes it will basically
rerender all UI related to it. What makes is faster than other view library is <code>virtual dom</code> and diffing
argorithm.</p>

<h3>2. State of current frontend application</h3>

<p>So lets take one step back and see how we are building our frontend application.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/static/img/current_application_state.png" alt="State of current frontend application" /></p>

<p>what above diagram says is we split our data on level of small views. We store data at level of view.</p>

<h3>3. React way of frontend application</h3>

<p>But as I said react is function which maps data to UI. Data and UI now becomes totaly different things.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/static/img/react_way.png" alt="State of current frontend application" /></p>

<p>This is very interesting way to build and think about application. And it creates different set of challeges while dealing with data in react and thats where things get interesting. But how can we solve it ?</p>

<h3>4.Flux architecture</h3>

<p><a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/">Flux</a> architecture is created at facebook to tackle problem created by React way of doing things.
flux can be explained as <code>unidirectional data flow</code> architecture.
Let&rsquo;s dive deep into various part of flux.</p>

<h4>4.1 Stores</h4>

<p>So we can current understading of react as</p>

<pre><code>data ==&gt; UI
</code></pre>

<p>but remember there are many functionality surrounding data like who will access data, what is policy to edit data and so on ?</p>

<p>So data is not just plain object. To avoid confusion let&rsquo;s call data as <code>Store</code>. So now we have</p>

<pre><code>Stores ==&gt; UI
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to point out that <code>Stores</code> are not <code>model</code> from MVC.</p>

<p>Another important things to understand here is UI can only read data directly from Stores but can not update it because undirectional nature of flux.</p>

<h4>4.2 Action</h4>

<p>consider <code>Actions</code> are things happen in application. For example in todo app following can be actions</p>

<ul>
<li>Add TODO</li>
<li>Delete TODO</li>
<li>Edit TODO</li>
</ul>


<p>Remeber these are not DOM events. So now we have</p>

<pre><code>Action    Stores ==&gt; UI
</code></pre>

<h4>4.3 Dispatcher</h4>

<p>So basically missing part between action and stores is dispatcher.</p>

<p>Following are functionality of <code>dispatcher</code></p>

<ol>
<li>every action should passes through dispatcher</li>
<li>every store register to dispatcher</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>Action ==&gt; Dispatcher ==&gt; Stores ==&gt; UI
</code></pre>

<h4>4.4 Flux event flow diagram</h4>

<p>here is full diagram explaining how flux undirectional data flow architecture works</p>

<pre><code>                                     (Action)
                   _______________________________________________
                   |          |                                  ^
                   v          V                                  |
                Server ==&gt; Action ==&gt; Dispatcher ==&gt; Stores ==&gt; UI
</code></pre>

<p>So UI handle user input by invoking <code>Action</code> or <code>Server</code>, which in tern make call to dispacher which send action to stores. Stores depend on action changes data, and fire event which will be capture by UI then UI get data from Store.</p>

<h4>4.5 What about multiple store scenario ?</h4>

<p>But real world application we can have number of stores for example in our TODO app we can have User, TODOs as store.</p>

<p>here is how flux architecture propose solution for it</p>

<pre><code>                                    Action &lt;------------| 
                                       |                |
                                       v                |
                                   Dispatcher           | 
                                       |                |
                              _________v_________       |
                             |                   |      | 
                             v                   v      |
                          Store 1             Store 2   |
                             |___________________|      |
                             |                   |      | 
                             v                   v      | 
                           View 1              View 2 --|
                             |__________________________|
</code></pre>

<p>So all stores share same action and dispatcher. It means every stores register itself with single dispatcher, which send every action recieved from <code>Action</code> to <code>Stores</code></p>

<h4>4.6 What is Flux ?</h4>

<p>So we can explain flux using following points</p>

<ul>
<li>unidirectional data flow</li>
<li>multiple store</li>
<li>It is specification and can have multiple implementation</li>
</ul>


<h3>5. Redux</h3>

<p><a href="http://rackt.org/redux/">Redux</a> is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
You can say it is implementation on <code>flux</code>. It is higly influence by <a href="https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial">elm architecture</a></p>

<p>Followings are important features of <code>redux</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Single Store (single source of truth)</li>
<li>Immutable</li>
<li>no Dispatcher</li>
</ul>


<p>if look back achitecture of <code>flux</code> and role on <code>dispatcher</code> , dispatcher just send all actions to registered stores. But in redux we only have single store which means we do not require <code>dispatcher</code> as seperate entity.</p>

<p>Another important thing is,  if you consider what happen when action happen on stores, stores usually apply business logic which result in change in state(data) to notify it, it fires date change event.</p>

<p>Redux seperate this business logic from <code>Stores</code> as these can be written as normal functions. These function know as <code>Reducer</code></p>

<h4>5.1 Reducer</h4>

<p><code>Reducer</code> in redux are simple functions which take current state and action to perform gives back new state.</p>

<pre><code>(PreviousState, Action) ==&gt; NewState
</code></pre>

<p>this makes redux immutable !!!</p>

<p>Redux do not force immutability. But encourage it.</p>

<h4>5.2 flow in Redux</h4>

<p>so we action and event flow in redux look like this</p>

<pre><code>                                  |-------------------|
                                  |        Reducer    |
                                  |         ^ |       |
                                  v         | v       |
                                Action ==&gt; Store ==&gt; UI
                                       (dispatcher)
</code></pre>

<p>Another thing to notice here is <code>flux</code> and <code>redux</code> are not tied up with <code>React</code>.
You can implement above architecture in any framework.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://victorsavkin.com/post/99998937651/building-angular-apps-using-flux-architecture">flux + Angular</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wbuchwalter/ng2-redux">redux + Angular 2</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I gave this talk in mumbai ruby meetup in october. here are my slides</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="7e9fd442d63d4c768a4bb695eafee090" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>


<p>It can be difficult to start thinking data flow in your app right away but when you setup your app according to <code>flux</code> or <code>redux</code> then your app will become more simpler and adding new feature wont
take so much time.</p>

<p>Keep making awesome app in react !!!</p>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Docker !! , Docker has been buzz world in technology world lately, and many people
are jumping into it. But there are so many what/why/how questions about docker is
present in newbie&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>First I wont go in depth details about in docker in this post.</p>

<p>Lets get answers for these questions step by step.</p>

<h2>What is Docker ?</h2>

<p>here is description for docker from http://www.docker.com</p>

<pre><code>Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run
distributed applications
</code></pre>

<p>So first docker is open source platform which helps not only developer develop distributed
systems but also help sysadmins manage these systems in diverse environment.</p>

<p>This is containers for our application like we have containers in shipping industry.</p>

<h2>Ok But why we need Docker ?</h2>

<p>If you look around, you will see your development team is using variety of OS
for developing application most probably they are using windows/OSX and we usually
have linux based system in production. Problem
with this is many technology which we uses for building this systems usually behave
differently is different OS. Many time you will see people complaining about
this code is working on my machine but not working on production  or my colleague&rsquo;s
machine.</p>

<p>But when you <code>Dockerized</code> your app you can use it on any OS. Thats really make
things simpler not only for developer but also sysadmin.</p>

<p>Also docker provide on hub where pre build Dockerized apps are present which are
very great to getting started with project.</p>

<h2>How is this different from Virtual Machines?</h2>

<p>As you mentioned earlier that docker is container, next question pops into your
mind is <code>isn't it similar to Virtual Machines ?</code>. And this is valid question.</p>

<p>Here is explaination for this from http://www.docker.com</p>

<p><img src="http://siliconangle.com/files/2014/08/Docker-vs-Virtualization.jpg" alt="Docker VS Virtual Machines" /></p>

<p>From this it is clear that docker is more portable, light weight than VM.
which is great.</p>

<h1>How can we use Docker ?</h1>

<p>So all you excited about docker ? Lets use them in hosting simple static website</p>

<p>I wont cover installation of docker here. There is great explaination <a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation">here</a>.</p>

<p>Lets do something simple but exciting. Lets run our simple Hello world static
website. What is better than <code>Nginx</code> to server static content.</p>

<p>Lets create directory named HelloDocker.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir HelloDocker
cd HelloDocker
</code></pre>

<p>Create directory where we will have simple <code>index.html</code>. And our simple html</p>

<pre><code>
mkdir app
touch ./app/index.html
echo "&lt;h1&gt;Hellow Docker!!&lt;/h1&gt;" &gt; ./app/index.html
</code></pre>

<p>Docker require <code>Dockerfile</code> in root directory of you app to identity it is <code>Dockerized</code> app</p>

<pre><code>touch Dockerfile
</code></pre>

<p>Add following code in your <code>Dockerfile</code></p>

<pre><code>FROM kyma/docker-nginx
ADD app/ /var/www
CMD 'nginx'
</code></pre>

<p>Let me explain code we added in Dockerfile.
As I mentioned earlier docker hub has pre build docker images for many applications.
So in first line we are imporing <code>nginx</code> image from hub using <code>FROM kyma/docker-nginx</code>.
This makes our docker container extendable which help us to make reusable docker images.</p>

<p>To host our website in nginx we have to move content of <code>app</code> folder to <code>/var/www</code> folder provided by
imported nginx docker image.</p>

<p>Lastly just run <code>nginx</code> to start our nginx.</p>

<p>You might be seeing lots of costume command in Dockerfile which are specific for docker.
You can learn about it <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/">here</a></p>

<p>PS: remember code in Dockerfile is specific to our imported nginx image. If you change image you might require to change code.</p>

<p>So lets build our first docker image using running following command in root directory</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t chetan/HelloDocker .
</code></pre>

<p>Here we are creating docker image of our app and tagged it as <code>chetan/HelloDocker</code>. And last <code>.</code> is for directory from which
we have to create docker image.</p>

<p>You can check your image by runing following command</p>

<pre><code>docker image
</code></pre>

<p>Lets run this our simple docker app by following command</p>

<pre><code>docker run -p 8080:80 -d chetan/HelloDocker
</code></pre>

<p>Running your image with -d runs the container in detached mode, leaving the container running in the background.
The -p flag redirects a public port(8080) to a private port(80) in the container.</p>

<p>To check our website is working run following command</p>

<pre><code>curl localhost:8080
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah!!! we run our first docker app. Isn&rsquo;t it simple ?</p>

<p>Happy Dockering !!!</p>

<p>PS: If you are using <code>boot2docker</code> to run docker then run following command to visit our website</p>

<pre><code>curl $(boot2docker ip):8080
</code></pre>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>One fine weekend I asked <em>Sam</em> one question &ldquo;How to create dynamic graph on server side?&rdquo;. Question made <em>Sam</em>
think little but after sometime <em>Sam</em> came back with answer as usual and said &ldquo;why not use <strong>phantom.js</strong> here ?&rdquo;..After
noticing my confused face <em>Sam</em> started to explain me solution step by step, here is how we solve this problem,</p>

<p>1.Create simple line chart in browser</p>

<p>Creating line chart was simple task. We selected <a href="https://razorflow.com/features/">razorflow</a> as our charting library
(you can select library of your choice) and we came up with very simple line chart, below is simple code snippet to do it,</p>

<pre><code class="js">
function chart1(data) {
  StandaloneDashboard(function(db){
    var chart = new ChartComponent(data['caption']);
    chart.setDimensions (7, 7);
    chart.setCaption(data['caption']);
    chart.setLabels (data['labels']);
    chart.addSeries (data["series"]["id"], data["series"]["name"], data["series"]["seriesData"], {
      seriesDisplayType: "line"
    });
    chart.setYAxis(data["yaxis"]["label"], {numberPrefix: data["yaxis"]["numberPrefix"], numberHumanize: true});
    db.addComponent (chart);
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is full version of above code with output</p>

<p><a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/laxoka/4/embed?html,output">JS Bin</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script>.</p>

<p>We are storing data into <code>window.data</code> so that we can give it to <em>razorflow</em> to render graph. And we done rendering line chart in browser. Most of above code is chart library related.</p>

<p>2.Render Graph using <em>PhantomJS</em> on server side and create PNG image</p>

<p>We are using awesome <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> library to get headless browser at server side. You can install <em>PhantomJS</em> on your machine by following instructions <a href="http://phantomjs.org/download.html">here</a>.
But we are not installing <em>phantomjs</em> manually, we are using awesome <em><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs">phantomjs</a></em> module from <em><a href="https://npmjs.com">npm</a></em>,
Here is code snippet which render graph and create PNG of it</p>

<pre><code class="js">  //filename : phantomjs_render.js
  var page = require('webpage').create();

  page.onLoadFinished   = function(status) {
    if (status === 'success') {
        setTimeout(function () {
          page.render('./static_graph.png')
        }, 0)
        phantom.exit();
    } else {
      phantom.exit();
    }
  };  

  page.open('line_graph.html', function () {
  });
</code></pre>

<p>lets run above code using following command</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ phantomjs ./phantomjs_render.js
</code></pre>

<p>Lets assume that above html code is in <code>line_graph.html</code> file. We are using  <em>phantomJS</em> to open html file (or url) in headless browser
and on loading finish it will create png and store it in <code>statis_graph.png</code>. We are using <a href="http://phantomjs.org/api/webpage/method/render.html">render</a> api which help
us to create png.</p>

<p>And remember to exit phantomjs browser using <code>phantom.exit()</code> otherwise your process wont exit.</p>

<p>But remember we want to create dynamic graph images on server side &hellip; so we solve 50% of problem. let solve remaining 50%.</p>

<p>3.Create dynamic graphs</p>

<p>Lets continue with our current example. We are able to generate static graph image.
To make graph true-ly  dynamic we have to some how send data dynamically to <code>line_graph.html</code>. We did modify our phantomjs_render.js file to accomplish this goal.
code snippet is below.</p>

<pre><code class="js">  //filename : phantomjs_render.js
  var page = require('webpage').create();
  var system = require('system');
  var args = system.args;
  var data = JSON.parse(system.args[1])


  page.onLoadFinished   = function(status) {
    if (status === 'success') {
      page.evaluate(function(d) {
        window.chart(d)
      }, data);

      setTimeout(function () {
        page.render('./static_graph.png')
      }, 0)
      phantom.exit();
    } else {
      phantom.exit();
    }
  };  

  page.open('line_graph.html', function () {});
</code></pre>

<p>We have to run following command to run above code in terminal</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ phantomjs ./phantomjs_render.js  stringified_data
</code></pre>

<p>Remember we can not have command arguemnt as json so we have to convert json data to string using <code>JSON.stringify</code>.</p>

<p>We are using in build <code>system</code> from phantomjs to get argument list provided to <em>phantomjs</em> command.</p>

<p>Here we are sending our data as second argument to <strong>phantomjs</strong> command which we can get in our javascript code from <code>line_graph.html</code> using <em><a href="http://phantomjs.org/api/system/property/args.html">system.args</a></em> api.</p>

<p>Another interesting api we are using is <em><a href="http://phantomjs.org/api/webpage/method/evaluate.html">page.evaluate</a></em> which help us to run any javascript code in context of webpage in phatomjs
browser. On <code>onLoadFinished</code> event on page we are calling <code>chart</code> method and pass our dynamic data to webpage which can be use to create line chart.</p>

<p>4.No!! No command line stuff</p>

<p>I exclaimed !! Sam replied calmly with &ldquo;Why not use <code>child_process</code> from node to run above code?&rdquo;, and with that we solve another problem. Here is code how to do it,</p>

<pre><code class="js">//filename : phantomjs_test.js

  var phantomjs = require('phantomjs')
    , path = require('path')
    , childProcess = require('child_process')

  var binPath = phantomjs.path;


  var createImage = function (data, url /*may be file path*/) {
    var childArgs = [
      path.join(__dirname, 'phantomjs_render.js'),
      JSON.stringify(data),
    ];


    var spawn = childProcess.spawn
    spawn(binPath, childArgs)
  }
</code></pre>

<p>run above code using following command</p>

<pre><code class="sh">node phantomjs_test.js
</code></pre>

<p>so here we are spawning new child process with  <code>phantomjs_render.js</code> and  stringify data as arguments. We can also pass other parameters
dynamically. Thats it !! problem has been solved, Isn&rsquo;t it simple ? :)</p>

<p>5.Advance Usage</p>

<p>I asked this question to Sam because i want to send these dynamically generated graph image in email. Email or preciously email client
has very poor support for SVG and embedded image. So you have to use <code>img</code> tag. Either you can put these dynamically generated
image to <code>s3</code> or generate dynamically when request come for it. You can find advance code for it <a href="https://github.com/chetandhembre/blog/tree/master/dynamic_graph_image_phantomjs">here</a>.</p>
